Say Hello - Endpoint
We have to create a program that will say hello to us.

Peer reviewed by: Jacob Dekok - The code looks very organized and well put together. The program runs as intended.

INSTRUCTIONS
Before anything, open the code in VSCode and run/debug the code. This should lead to a new tab opening, labelled localhost. Copy and paste the URL from that new tab, into the Postman "GET" area. Then, add to the end of the URL like this: 
https://localhost:xxxx/Speak/Hello/(name)/(good/bad/etc.)
The xxxx should be the 4-digit number individual to your computer. Then you wil have /Speak/Hello, and in the next two spaces I have labelled, you will enter your name and how you are doing. Then, hit "Send". Text should appear as if you have had a conversation, where the console will repeat your name, show your answer as to how you're doing, and then wish you a nice day.
